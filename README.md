# OKRs vs WOOP

[OKRs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR) are well-known. According to Google there are 18 million pages contain this term.
Objectives and key results (OKR) is a goal-setting framework for defining and tracking objectives and their outcomes.

[WOOP](https://woopmylife.org/) is less well-known. According to Google there are 6 million pages.
WOOP (Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan) is a science-based mental strategy that people can use to find and fulfill their wishes, set preferences, and change their habits.


# Context

OKRs: OKRs are mostly used in a company context. Only few people use OKRs for their personal goals

WOOP: WOOP is used mostly for personal goals/wishes. AFAIK it does not get used in a company context often.

# The parts of the methods

OKRs: Objectives and Key-Results

WOOP: Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan

# Goal

OKRs is about "goals". WOOP is about "wishes".

It depends on you. For some there is a difference, for some not.

For me there is only a little difference between both terms.

# Key-Result - Outcome

OKRs focus on measurable key-results.

WOOP calls it outcome. In the book Rethinking Postive Thinking are several examples for measurable outcomes.

Again. Both methods are quite equal here.

# Obstacle

OKRs have two parts. The objective and the key-results.

WOOP has something called obstacle. That's where active negative thinking is started: What could go wrong?

I like this part. It is called mental contrasting. First you "paint" your dream/wish. But in this step
you actively check for obstacles which could stop you from achieving your goal.

That's why I like WOOP. First you dream, then you do the reality check.

# Plan

After you listed the obstacles, you create plans. What could you do if these obstacles will raise?

It is good to have a plan. I love it.

# Conclusion

My personal, biased perspective: I prefer WOOP.



# Objectives
